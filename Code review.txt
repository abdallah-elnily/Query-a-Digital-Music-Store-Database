Well done!

Everything was just fine so there wasn't really much to say. The queries are flawless and it's pretty clear that you have a solid understanding of what SQL is all about.

You're definitely ready to take on some bigger challenges now. Please keep up the good work and go the extra mile in your coming projects, just like you did here. You show great aptitude for data analysis.

Keep being awesome!
SQL Queries

All SQL queries run without errors and produce the intended results.

Each SQL query needs to include one or more explicit join(s). The query's JOIN or JOINs should be necessary to answer the question. If a question does not require a JOIN, please change the question to be one that does.

Example:
SELECT *
FROM Album
JOIN Track on Track.AlbumID = Album.AlbumID

Each SQL query needs to include one or more aggregation(s). This could be a COUNT, AVG, SUM, or other aggregation.

The student has used at least 4 unique SQL queries in their submission.
Presentation

Each slide should have an appropriate title, and the visualization descriptions should be free of significant factual, spelling, and grammar mistakes.

All visualizations should make logical sense and provide accurate information about the indicated area.

All visualizations include a title and axis labels, have a legend where applicable, and are easily understood.

Every visualization should have

    chart title
    x-axis title
    x-axis labels
    y-axis title
    y-axis labels

Submission Phase

A PDF report has been uploaded, and a .txt file with the queries has been uploaded in a single zipped folder file
